        // if some bit of the XOR result is 1, it means that the two target numbers differ at that location.

        // Letâ€™s say the at the ith bit, the two desired numbers differ from each other. which means one number has bit i equaling: 0, the other number has bit i equaling 1.

        // Thus, all the numbers can be partitioned into two groups according to their bits at location i.
        // the first group consists of all numbers whose bits at i is 0.
        // the second group consists of all numbers whose bits at i is 1.

        // Notice that, if a duplicate number has bit i as 0, then, two copies of it will belong to the first group.
        // Similarly, if a duplicate number has bit i as 1, then, two copies of it will belong to the second group.

        // by XoRing all numbers in the first group, we can get the first number.
